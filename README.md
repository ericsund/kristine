TODO
- Switch to text input capability
- Actually do useful stuff

USAGE

- Execute build.sh to build
- Execute run.sh to run
- Your "classpath" tells Voce where the class files are.  Doesn't matter where
as long as the path is correct.  Keep everything in that folder.
  - This means you can change the classpath in build.sh and run.sh if you move
  your class files folder
